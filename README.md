## 🎯 About

</div>

ComprarApp is a "to buy" todo list app I built during [Rocketseat's](https://www.rocketseat.com.br) [React Native 2025 course](https://app.rocketseat.com.br/journey/react-native-2025/contents) as part of the Fundamentals Module. It's basically a simple shopping list where you can add items you need to buy and check them off as you go - perfect for practicing React Native basics with something useful!

## 🔄 Development Process

</div>

### Learning Methodology
This course is audio/video, and for this scenario I use a methodology that I saw while I watched my first videos about Software Development with Delphi -- on YouTube on [Rodrigo Mourao's channel](https://www.youtube.com/@rm.mourao/videos), the old "[RM Factory](https://lp.rmfactory.com.br)" -- where we watch a video at least 3 times. 

In the first time, we just watch without caring about anything: no drafts, no pencil/pen, paper or whatever, **JUST WATCH**.

In the second time we rewatch but now taking some notes about the words, terms or other things that stand out to us. At the end of the second time that we're watching, we stop and take time to scratch the surface of the words, terms and other things, but just a superficial search, nothing deep because if you're like me, this will bring you more than 20 tabs and only after hours you'll think "Oh good, I have a class to return to watching 😱" 🤣.

Finally, in the third time that you watch, you'll be watching with fresh eyes and a new perspective because now you have more information to connect the dots that you couldn't before. I don't know if this is the reason but it's close to when you read a book or watch a movie multiple times if you do it more than 3 times, you'll pick up on things you missed, and the same exact thing can have more meanings than you realize.

This is called **EXPERIENCE**.

After these steps, we're able to try to reproduce everything we watched in the course, using just our notes and **what stuck with us**, without going back and forth between the course screen and our IDE. I don't think that's a good learning process.

### Implementation Approach
As for the implementation approach, here I did something new. Unlike the backend, the frontend API provides a clear visual progression of how we started and how we ended. I tried to commit frequently, step by step, so that each commit brings a significant improvement to the code or interface! This way, anyone who watches the _<ins>demo below<ins>_ or looks at the code from the first commit can learn, understand, and evolve alongside me as I was building the project.
